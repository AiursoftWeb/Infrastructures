# Khala

>"For we are bound by the Khala, the sacred union of our every thought and emotion."
>——Hierarch Artanis, StarCraft II: Legacy of the Void

In Starcraft, Protoss society is shown in the background of the series to have been tribal with a strong warrior culture until a planet-wide civil war allowed a mystic, Khas, to access a natural psionic link shared by all Protoss. Khas' discovery and teachings, labelled the Khala, are then used as the principle underlying a new caste-based society.
